# Stellar Examples
A simple repo on few test I've made while learning how to create Stellar transactions.

I've started to learn about Stellar and how to create Smart Contracts. I believe it's fairly simple, so I'll use this repo as my learning tool

## How to use this?
- Go to [this](https://www.stellar.org/laboratory/#account-creator?network=test) website to generate accounts and fund them. The link is for the testnet.
- Simply `npm install` it.
- Configure the keys on `keys.js`
- Then, on `/examples` you can run `node example-<NUMBER>.js`.

### Example 1 - The crowdsale
Create your token and deploy it.
